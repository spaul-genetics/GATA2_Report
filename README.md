# GATA2_Report

## Overview

GATA2 mutations cause adult-onset bone-marrow failure characterized by cytopenias, infections and increased risk of myeloid malignancy. We reviewed hospital records and referrals of 232 GATA2 mutation positive individuals from 122 families to gather hematopoietic and syndromic features.
Mutations were categorized by GATA2 protein effect: mutation after the 2nd Zinc-finger (C-term, n=10); missense in the 2nd Zinc-Finger (2nd ZF, n=104); mutations producing stable truncated protein (Truncation, n=22); Null alleles (mRNA instability, large deletions, n=46); or Enhancer (n=50).
Regression models for symptom onset identified earlier onset and increased hazard ratios (HR) between Truncation, Null or 2nd ZF mutations (13 years, HR 5.00; 17 years, 3.60; 22 years, 2.23 respectively) and Enhancer. Commonly mutated 2nd ZF amino acids stratified: R396 or T354 presented earlier with increased hazard ratios (16 years, HR 2.96; 19 years, HR 2.16) versus R398 (34 years). Specific phenotypes including cytopenias, infections, HPV, thrombotic events and hearing loss were more common in mutation groups with median onset <20 years. Warts/anogenital HPV were common (93/232, 40.1%). Non-hematologic manifestations included hearing loss (46/232; 19.8%), lymphedema (30/232; 12.8%), and non-hematologic malignancies (46/232, 19.8%), the majority being HPV-related ano-genital cancers. Leukemia or lymphoma occurred in 25/232 patients (10.8%).
